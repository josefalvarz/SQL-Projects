Tesla is one of the most discussed companies online, often subject to both praise, criticism and in the last months controversy. That's why we as a group decided to analyze Tesla's public sentiment.

Project Goal 

The main goal of this project is to analyze public sentiment around Tesla by leveraging social media data, from Reddit. Our goal is to understand how people talk in the comments regarding Tesla and provide key insights into what aspects they can improve. Our goal is to get real world experience with data analysis and all the processes that go with it.

Business Value

Tesla operates in a competitive and volatile market. Real time sentiment analysis helps in:
-	Identifying risks or emerging controversies.
-	Evaluate public reaction to events.	
-	Hear what customers are concerned about and their opinions.

Methodology

We used a data pipeline combining APIs, Python, MapReduce, SQL, and Tableau
1.	Collected Reddit data using APIs
2.	Cleaned and processed the data with MapReduce (Hadoop)
3.	Queried processed data in SQL
4.	Run sentiment analysis in Python
5.	Visualized data results in Tableau 

Results

The analysis reveals a clear contrast in how Tesla is perceived: while financial discussions around stocks and investments generate predominantly positive sentiment, conversations about technology and products lean strongly toward neutral or negative views. Subreddits focused on technology, in particular, show high engagement but with critical tones around features such as autopilot, Cybertruck, and repairs.
